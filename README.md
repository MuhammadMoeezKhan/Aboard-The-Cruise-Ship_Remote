<br>
Created an Android Full-Stack App for Cruise companies to efficiently manage, track, manipulate, and share all Information for the company's Cruises!
<br>

<br>

Utilized:
- _Retrofit Library_ -->  Is a type-safe REST client for Android which helps us consume RESTful web services
- _Gson Library_ --> Java library that can be used to convert Java Objects into their JSON representation and vice versa
- _Cyberduck_ --> FTP client used to manage and track files being transfered over the internet (Used Here For PHP Files)
- _MySQL Workbenches_ --> To CRUD with Relational MySQL databases over a MySQL server.

<br>
Planning to operate a Cruise Ship Company! Use the App!
