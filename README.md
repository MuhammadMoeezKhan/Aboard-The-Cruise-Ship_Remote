#### I created an Android Full-Stack App for Cruise companies to efficiently manage, track, manipulate, and share all Information for the company's Cruises!

<br>

The application utilizes:
- **Retrofit Library** :arrow_forward:	  Is a type-safe REST client for Android that helps us consume RESTful web services
- **Gson Library** :arrow_forward:	 Java library that can be used to convert Java Objects into their JSON representation and vice versa
- **Cyberduck** :arrow_forward:	 FTP client used to manage and track files being transferred over the internet (Used Here For PHP Files)
- **MySQL Workbenches** :arrow_forward:	 To CRUD with Relational MySQL databases over a MySQL server.

<br>
Planning to operate a Cruise Ship Company! Use the App!
